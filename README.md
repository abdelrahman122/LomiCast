# LomiCast v1

This application provides display and control of Android devices connected on
USB (or [over TCP/IP][article-tcpip]). It does not require any _root_ access.
It works on _GNU/Linux_, _Windows_ and _macOS_.


It focuses on:

 - **lightness** (native, displays only the device screen)
 - **performance** (30~60fps)
 - **quality** (1920Ã—1080 or above)
 - **low latency** ([35~70ms][lowlatency])
 - **low startup time** (~1 second to display the first image)
 - **non-intrusiveness** (nothing is left installed on the device)



## Requirements

The Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).

Make sure you [enabled adb debugging][enable-adb] on your device(s).

[enable-adb]: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#Enabling

On some devices, you also need to enable [an additional option][control] to
control it using keyboard and mouse.
